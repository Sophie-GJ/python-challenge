Source coude for PyBank and PyPoll, exst in the Resources folder of python-challenge.

Due to issues on my end getting my code to find paths for csv files, I have included in both PyBank and PyPoll the following line of code, which I received from Kourt Bailey during a tutoring session.
os.chdir(os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)))

I sourced sample code from websites to create and write a text file. It is also noted in my code for both projects.

For PyPoll, I received help from two AskBCS Learning Assistants. Their contributions of sample code are also noted within the comments.

The analysis for PyBank and PyPoll are found in their respective folders.
