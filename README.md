Source coude for these two projects: PyBank and PyPoll, exst in the Resources folder of python-challenge.

Due to issues on my end getting my code to find paths for csv files, I have included in both PyBank and PyPoll the following line of code, which I received from Kourt Bailey during a tutoring session.
os.chdir(os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)))

Additionally, I took code I sourced from www.w3schools.com to create and write a text file. It is also noted in my code for both projects.
